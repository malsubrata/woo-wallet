== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 7.4 or greater is required (PHP 8.0 or greater is recommended)
* MySQL 5.6 or greater, OR MariaDB version 10.1 or greater, is required
* WordPress 6.0 or greater is required
* WooCommerce 7.2 or greater is required

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Wallet Payment, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "Wallet for WooCommerce" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the wallet endpoints pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.

= Important =

A hidden "Wallet Topup" product is automatically created upon activation. Ensure it remains **Published** and **Private**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does wallet payment work? =
Wallet payment acts as a native WooCommerce gateway. Customers with sufficient balance can select "Wallet" at checkout to pay for their order instantly.

= Does it support partial payment? =
Yes! If enabled in settings, customers can use their wallet balance to pay for a portion of the order and cover the remainder with another gateway like Stripe or PayPal.

= When is cashback applied? =
Cashback is triggered by order status changes. You can configure which status (e.g., 'Completed' or 'Processing') triggers the reward in the plugin settings.

= Why is the wallet not visible at checkout? =
Ensure the Wallet gateway is enabled in **WooCommerce > Settings > Payments**. Also, check if "Hide if empty" is enabled in TeraWallet settings if the user has a zero balance.

= Where can I get support? =
You can ask for help in the [WordPress Plugin Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-wallet) or email us at support@standalonetech.com.
